A simple, student-built health & fitness app to **log workouts** (name, notes, sets, reps, weight).  
Built with **Expo (React Native)** + **TypeScript** and designed to look clean (inspired by Duolingo / Headspace / Airbnb).  
This project is part of my portfolio and learning journey—aimed at practicing real SWE habits (Git/GitHub, PRs, linting, small commits).

## Features (MVP)
- Email + password auth (Firebase) – _coming next_
- Add a workout: **name**, **description/reminders**, **sets**, **reps**, **weight**
- List workouts (most recent first)
- Lightweight, readable code—no fancy abstractions

## Tech Stack
- **Mobile**: Expo (React Native), TypeScript
- **Backend-as-a-service**: Firebase Auth + Firestore (coming next)
- **Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, GitHub Actions (later)
