# Align

A student-built health & fitness app for logging workouts, built with React Native and TypeScript. This project showcases my learning journey in mobile development and software engineering practices.

## 📱 About

**Align** is a personal portfolio project that demonstrates my growth as a computer science student. Inspired by the clean, intuitive design of apps like Duolingo, Headspace, and Airbnb, I built this workout tracker to practice real-world software engineering skills.

## ✨ Features

- **Add Workouts**: Log workout details including name, description, sets, reps, and weight
- **Clean Navigation**: Seamless navigation between Home and Add Workout screens using Expo Router
- **Modern UI**: Clean, minimalist design focused on user experience
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety for better code quality and developer experience

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Navigation**: Expo Router
- **Styling**: React Native StyleSheet
- **Development**: ESLint, Prettier
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## 🎨 Branding

I created custom assets to give Align its own visual identity:

- **`align-logo-minimal-1024x1024.png`** → Used for app icon, Android adaptive icon, and web favicon
- **`align-logo.png`** → Used for the splash screen when the app loads

The design follows a clean, minimalist approach that matches the app's focus on simplicity and user experience.
